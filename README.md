A simple iOS Video Player and Recorder


This is a simple player/recorder example demonstrating a video player that can play a video and record the user with an embedded preview inside the video view.

The recorder is implemented with AVCaptureSession. After recording the video a preview modal shows the recorded video. 

The player uses the MPMovieController class.
